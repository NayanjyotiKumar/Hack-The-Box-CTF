## BagBounty

In a first phase we go `bagbouty`, we were provided with the code is a good way to start.

    .

    â””â”€â”€ supervisord.conf

Immediately in the file `web_jscalc/challenge/helpers/calculatorHelper.js` we find the presence of an `eval()` function.

    module.exports = {
        calculate(formula) {
            try {
                return eval(`(function() { return ${ formula } ;}())`);
    
            } catch (e) {
                if (e instanceof SyntaxError) {
                    return 'Something went wrong!';
                }
            }
        }
    }

<span class="underline">Attenction!</span>

    return eval(`(function() { return ${ formula } ;}())`);

-   `function() { return ${ formula }; }`

This appears to be a template literal that creates an anonymous function. The formula variable seems to contain some expression or formula that's being interpolated into this function.

-   `eval(...)`

The entire template literal is passed into eval(), which attempts to execute the code within it as JavaScript.

This code snippet seems to be constructing a function dynamically based on the formula variable and then evaluating it using eval(). This approach can be powerful but may also pose security risks, especially if the formula variable contains `user input` or untrusted data.


## Attack Vector

Googling to refresh my memory I stumble upon this ineresting [article](https://medium.com/@sebnemK/node-js-rce-and-a-simple-reverse-shell-ctf-1b2de51c1a44).

In a nutshell, we can create an `attack vector` that depending on the case can use these two functions of the library '`fs`':

`readdir()` => Just as the dir command in MS Windows or the ls command on Linux, it is possible to use the method `readdir` or `readdirSync` of the fs class to list the content of the directory. 

`readFile()` => The methods `readFile` or `readFileSync` provide the option to read the entire content of a file.

## Payload

Now with these fixed concepts in mind let's go forge the payload.
For read `dir`.

    require('fs').readdirSync('..').toString()

For read `file`.

    require('fs').readFileSync('../flag.txt').toString()
